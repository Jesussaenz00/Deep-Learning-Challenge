# Deep-Learning-Challenge
Challenge 21

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a binary classification model using deep learning techniques to predict the success of organizations funded by Alphabet Soup. By analyzing historical data and identifying key features, the model will enable Alphabet Soup to make informed decisions about which organizations are most likely to succeed.

This challenge involves:

Preprocessing Data: Cleaning and preparing the dataset to enhance the model's predictive capability.
Building a Neural Network: Designing and training a deep learning model to classify organizations as successful or unsuccessful.
Optimizing Performance: Refining the model to achieve an accuracy rate higher than 75%, ensuring reliable predictions.
Delivering Insights: Documenting findings and providing recommendations for improving the model or exploring alternative approaches.
By accurately predicting success, this analysis will empower Alphabet Soup to allocate resources effectively and maximize the impact of its funding initiatives.
